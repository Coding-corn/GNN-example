# graphSAGE
This file contains a simple example of how to create a graphSAGE as detailed in [GraphSAGE: Scaling up Graph Neural Networks](https://mlabonne.github.io/blog/posts/2022-04-06-GraphSAGE.html).

[`results`](results) provides the animation and graphical results which should be obtained after running [`graphSAGE.py`](graphSAGE.py).
