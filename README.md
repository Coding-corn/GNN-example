## GNN-example
This repository illustrates some examples of graph neural networks (GNNs), which I have been learning from various online sources by emulating and adding extra functionality.
This includes illustrations and animations to better highlight the underlying learning process of the GNNs (which can be found in the respective `results` folders, as well as the refactoring of various functions to make the code more Pythonic.
All relevant sources used ae listed in their respective `README.md` file.

For an example of popular GNNs such as graphSAGE and graph isomorphism networks, refer to [refCode](refCode).

Note: [WIP](WIP) contains code which is currently being worked on and is therefore not yet ready for deployment.
