Notes (to tidy later):
- This repository serves as a testbed for graph neural networks implemented using the [pytorch_geometric](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric) package
- Focus on time series prediction using TGN, and TGAT
- Try a basic problem, possibly from the original TGN paper (TBD)
- Next, try using torch-geometric-temporal packages, with one of the datasets that is already in the library. Note that the datasets are mostly periodic and may therefore be highly restrictive
- Remember to cite the relevant sources directly, even if it lies in another repository containing it and a collection of other datasets!
