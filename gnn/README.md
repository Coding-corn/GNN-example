Notes (to tidy later):
- This repository serves as a testbed for graph neural networks implemented using the [pytorch_geometric](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric) package
- As a starting point, try out some toy models already implemented by other users
- Thereafter, focus on the datasets provided in [TUDatasets](https://chrsmrrs.github.io/datasets/). Don't forget to cite the relevant sources!
- First, focus on supervised machine learning by image resignation
- Next, move on to time series prediction
- Alternatively, graph kernels could be investigated too
