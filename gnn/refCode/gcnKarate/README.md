This file contains a simple example of how to create a graph convolutional network as detailed in [Graph Convolutional Networks: Introduction to GNNs](https://mlabonne.github.io/blog/posts/2022_02_20_Graph_Convolution_Network.html).

[`results`](./results) provides the animation and graphical results which should be obtained after running [`gcnKarate.py`](./gcnKarate.py).
