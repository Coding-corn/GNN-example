This file contains a simple example of how to create a graph convolutional network as detailed in [Graph Convolutional Networks: Introduction to GNNs](https://mlabonne.github.io/blog/posts/2022_02_20_Graph_Convolution_Network.html).

[`results`](./results) provides the animation and graphical results which should be obtained after running [`gcn.py`](gcn.py).

The most relevant paper regarding this project is [Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907).
