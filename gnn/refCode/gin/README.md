# gin
This file contains a simple example of how to create a graph isomorphism network (GIN) as detailed in [GIN: How to Design the Most Powerful Graph Neural Network](https://mlabonne.github.io/blog/posts/2022-04-25-Graph_Isomorphism_Network.html).

[`results`](./results) provides the animation and graphical results which should be obtained after running [`gin.py`](gin.py).

The most relevant paper regarding this project is [How Powerful are Graph Neural Networks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00826).
