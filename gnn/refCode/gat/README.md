This file contains a simple example of how to create a graph convolutional network as detailed in [Graph Attention Networks: Self-Attention for GNNs](https://mlabonne.github.io/blog/posts/2022-03-09-Graph_Attention_Network.html).

[`results`](./results) provides the animation and graphical results which should be obtained after running [`gat.py`](gat.py).

The most relevant paper regarding this project is [Graph Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903).
